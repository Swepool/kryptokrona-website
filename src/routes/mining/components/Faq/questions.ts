    question: "What is Kryptokrona mining and how does it work?",
    answer: "Kryptokrona mining is the process of using your computer's processing power to validate transactions and maintain the network. Miners solve complex cryptographic puzzles, and in return, they are rewarded with Kryptokrona coins. This process secures the network and ensures the integrity of transaction records."

  {
    question: "What is a mining pool, and should I join one?",
    answer: "A mining pool is a group of miners who combine their computational power to increase their chances of earning mining rewards. The rewards are then distributed among pool members based on their contributed processing power. Joining a mining pool can offer more consistent rewards compared to mining alone, especially if you have less powerful equipment."
