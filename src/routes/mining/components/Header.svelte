      <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 dark:text-neutral-400 text-neutral-600">Kryptokrona is a cryptocurrency that utilizes proof-of-work mining to establish distributed consensus. The information and resources provided below will assist you in getting started with mining. Please note that the Kryptokrona Project does not endorse any specific pool, software, or hardware; the content presented here is for informational purposes only.</p>

      <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 dark:text-neutral-400 text-neutral-600">A core tenet of Kryptokrona's philosophy is to promote equitable mining opportunities for everyone. To accomplish this, Kryptokrona employs a unique algorithm conceived and developed by members of the Kryptokrona community: RandomX. This proof-of-work algorithm is designed to be ASIC-resistant, making it infeasible for specialized hardware to mine Kryptokrona. Consequently, miners are required to utilize consumer-grade hardware and engage in fair competition.</p>

      <p class="my-6 text-lg leading-8 dark:text-neutral-400 text-neutral-600">Kryptokrona can be mined using both CPUs and GPUs; however, CPU mining is significantly more efficient in this context. Join the Kryptokrona mining community and contribute to the future of decentralized digital currency.</p>
